# NexusUI 2.0: Musician's Toolkit

This repository is a from-scratch refactor of NexusUI. Principles for the rewrite were:

- Integration with web audio
- Reliability over experimentation
- Addition of tuning and timing mechanisms
- More conventional Javascript API

For documentation and tutorials, see [the API](http://taylorbf.github.io/Musicians-Toolkit/api/).
